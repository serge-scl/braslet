# The initial pressure P0atm for the entire system is equal to atmospheric â€“ atm.
# Working volumes are constants.
# In the case of pressure, this is the total volume of all actuators V12act,
# and in the case of vacuum chambers V12vch.
# The total Tcl runtime is the few seconds that are acceptable for the end user to remove one glove.
# The volume of the air receivers - Vrx is the unknown target.
# Pressure - Prx / Pvx (positive or negative) in the receivers is also an unknown desired value.
