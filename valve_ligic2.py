# The first problem arises if, when the edge of the suction cup is poorly laid, air penetrates inside.
# In order to avoid leakage of outside air into the system, a separate vacuum chamber is provided.
# The inlet and outlet of the chamber locks two valve positions.
# In the first position, the valve is pressed against the suction cup opening by a spring,
# separating the suction cup from the vacuum chamber.
# In this case, the hole from the vacuum line to the chamber is open.
# In the second position, the magnet is activated, the valve armature opens
# the connection of the vacuum chamber with the suction cup and closes the hole in line.
